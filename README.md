### Real programming: copy, paste and debug.

I forget everything all the time. I just try to remember how to quickly and conveniently find the answers. For example, using github can be fiddly. I often forget exactly how to `push` a change or `pull` the most recent version of a repository. Just googling "_How to pull most rcent version of a repo_" and clicking the first or second hit is all it takes. 

This goes for everything. In general before you even try to write a script, go ahead and google it to see if someone has already written it and you could copy/paste. This is as fast (or usually faster) than being an awesome programmer. You can *hack* code together this way and it gets you surprisingly far. 

The other best resource on the web is [StackOverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com). Here you will find people asking questions they are having with writing a piece of code. About 90% of the time if you are having a problem writing a piece of code then someone else has already had that problem. So, you get an error? Perfect, copy and paste it into google, usually first hit will be stack overflow and very often the first answer will solve your problem.

Don't be ashamed of using these techniques! Coders rarely type super fast and look like Mr. Robot. The dirty truth is they sit around most of the day scratching their heads to find out why their software wont run. So copy, paste and debug.
