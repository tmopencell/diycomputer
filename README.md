**Parts List**

**Full list of parts:**
This list gives you the details about each item and why it was chosen and what to look for if you want to replace it with something different. While the goal was to keep the cost as low as possible we didn't just choose the cheapest item but rather the best based on a balance of performance/price. 

* [Touch Screen Display](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Raspberry-Pi-7-Inch-Screen-Display/dp/B014WKCFR4/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=smartpi+touch&qid=1570984115&sr=8-4)
This is the screen (about 7 inches) for interacting with the computer

* [Touchscreen and Computer Housing](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01HV97F64/ref=ox_sc_act_title_6?smid=A337FVOX35P1H8&psc=1)
This is the housing for the touchscreen and on the back the computer location

* [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07BDR5PDW/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=A1TGP1G2G7H27C&psc=1)
The actual computer. It is a credit card sized computer that was designed in Cambridge about 10 years ago. Depite being less than £40 it is still pretty nifty and we will make good use of it. 

* [microSD card](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B06XFZV9JY/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&psc=1)
This is the storage (memory) for the computer. It is where all the files and programs are stored. This one is pretty good, it has 64gb of memory which is fine but the read/write speed is impressive at about 100mb/sec. Basically the higher this number the better. 

* [Keyboard](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01G6XGLQQ/ref=ox_sc_act_title_5?smid=A2CBW8FNZCDSJI&psc=1)
You can use almost any keyboard. This one was cute and small wireless model and has a built in trackpad mouse which seemed convenient. Amazon also has the amazon basic range and that would be a good option too. 

* [MicroUSB power plug](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07FR9L4RC/ref=ox_sc_act_title_4?smid=A1FRA7QRK2Q428&psc=1)
This one is **5V** can deliver up to **3.0 A** meaning your computer, or battery will have plenty of juice (and is regulated meaning device will only draw as much current as they need). 

* [Battery (optional but good to have)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B075M9LXNY/ref=ox_sc_act_title_3?smid=A1BGBH9ECNVD5F&psc=1)
This is perfect if you want to make the device portable. You ideally want something with lots of energy and the units **mAh** indicates how much it has and a bigger number the better. This battery can deliver 24800 **mA** each hour **h**, this should mean that the computer can last 1-2 hours on a full charge!

### Real programming: copy, paste and debug.

I forget everything all the time. I just try to remember how to quickly and conveniently find the answers. For example, using github can be fiddly. I often forget exactly how to `push` a change or `pull` the most recent version of a repository. Just googling "_How to pull most rcent version of a repo_" and clicking the first or second hit is all it takes. 

This goes for everything. In general before you even try to write a script, go ahead and google it to see if someone has already written it and you could copy/paste. This is as fast (or usually faster) than being an awesome programmer. You can *hack* code together this way and it gets you surprisingly far. 

The other best resource on the web is [StackOverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com). Here you will find people asking questions they are having with writing a piece of code. About 90% of the time if you are having a problem writing a piece of code then someone else has already had that problem. So, you get an error? Perfect, copy and paste it into google, usually first hit will be stack overflow and very often the first answer will solve your problem.

Don't be ashamed of using these techniques! Coders rarely type super fast and look like Mr. Robot. The dirty truth is they sit around most of the day scratching their heads to find out why their software wont run. So copy, paste and debug.
